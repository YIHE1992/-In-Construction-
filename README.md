# Distraction_Affected_Crashes
In the United States, 3,477 road users were killed and 391,000 got injured in crashes caused by driver distraction in 2015. The situation in Louisiana is worse. Based on the Louisiana crash databases, in the past ten years (2006 to 2015), 55% of the total crashes were distraction-affected crashes, in which the drivers were identified as distracted at the occurrences of crashes. These distracted drivers resulted in 21% of fatal crashes and 56% of injury crashes in the state. To achieve the “Zero-Death Destination” objective, it is critical for the state to combat the distracted driving problem.  
  
Two types of distraction, internal and external distraction, are defined and investigated.  

The **random forests** algorithm was utilized to rank the contributing factors of the distraction-affected crashes: 
 
1. Applied the **out-of-bag** idea, instead of splitting training and testing datasets, to verify the accuracy,  
2. Analyzed the importance of each feature by **randomly permuting** the data in each column
